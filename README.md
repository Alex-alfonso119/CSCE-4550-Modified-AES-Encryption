# CSCE-4550-Modified-AES-Encryption
A program for my computer security class simulating a modified version of AES encryption

This was a program made for my computer security class at UNT (CSCE 4550)
It simulates a modified version of AES encryption given an input file, key file, and output file to write to.
NOTE: This does not fully represent AES encryption
